# Crop Disease Prediction Using Cloud & Machine Learning

### 🌾 Overview  
This project is a **cloud-based crop disease prediction system** that uses **Machine Learning + Serverless Cloud Functions**.  
Farmers upload a crop leaf image → the ML model predicts the disease → the result is stored in the cloud → accessible from web/app.




##  Features  
- 🌿 Crop leaf image upload  
- 🤖 ML model predicts disease  
- ☁️ Cloud storage for results  
- 📱 Web interface to view predictions  
- ⚡ Serverless backend (Firebase/AWS Lambda)  
- 📊 Dashboard showing past predictions

- Firebase Hosting (or any static hosting)

### **Backend**  
- Serverless Cloud Functions (Firebase / AWS / GCP)  
- Python API for ML model  
- Cloud Storage / Database

### **Machine Learning**

##  How It Works  
1. User uploads a leaf image  
2. Serverless function receives the image  
3. ML model predicts the disease  
4. Result stored in cloud DB  
5. User sees prediction in web/app
